# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This project is committed to respecting user privacy while operating within the functional requirements of the EVE Online ecosystem. Data collection and processing are intentionally limited to what is required for core functionality, security, and operational integrity.

Privacy is treated as a design constraint, not an afterthought.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All users of the application
- All data processed through the platform
- All integrations with external services required for operation

This policy does not cover:

- CCP Games–controlled systems or services
- Client-side environments outside the application’s control
- In-game behavior or communications within EVE Online itself

## Data Collection

### Data We Collect

The application may collect and process the following categories of data:

- Authentication identifiers provided by EVE Online Single Sign-On
- Character, corporation, or alliance identifiers required for authorization
- Operational metadata necessary for application functionality
- Audit and security-relevant event data

No data is collected for advertising, tracking, or profiling purposes.

### Data We Do Not Collect

- Real-world personal identifiers beyond what is provided by EVE SSO
- Behavioral tracking data
- Cross-site tracking or fingerprinting data
- Third-party analytics data

### Purpose of Processing

Collected data is used strictly for:

- Authentication and access control
- Authorization and role enforcement
- Synchronization with official EVE Online services
- Operational functionality of the application
- Security monitoring and auditability

Data is not repurposed beyond these objectives.

## External Services & Data Sharing

### External Integrations

The application integrates only with official EVE Online services, including:

- Authentication (SSO)
- Game data APIs

These integrations are required for core functionality and are not optional.

### Data Sharing

- Data is not sold, leased, or shared with third parties.
- No data is transmitted to external services beyond what is required for authentication or synchronization.
- There are no advertising, analytics, or marketing integrations.

## Data Storage & Residency

- All application data is stored under direct organizational control.
- Data is not outsourced to third-party data processors for analytics or tracking.
- External services are accessed on-demand and do not retain application-specific state.
- Data locality is treated as a strategic and privacy-preserving design choice.

## Access Control

- Data access is restricted by role-based permissions.
- Users can access only the data required for their assigned roles.
- Privileged access is limited and intentionally scoped.
- Internal access to sensitive data is minimized.

## Data Retention

- Data is retained only for as long as required for operational, security, or audit purposes.
- Retention periods are determined by functional necessity rather than convenience.
- Obsolete or unnecessary data is subject to removal as part of normal operations.

## Security of Data

Data protection measures include:

- Secure transport mechanisms
- Access control enforcement
- Audit logging of security-relevant events
- Segmentation of sensitive data

While reasonable safeguards are applied, no system can guarantee absolute security.

## User Expectations

Users should be aware that:

- Participation is voluntary.
- Access implies acceptance of the operational and privacy constraints of the platform.
- Trust is contextual and role-dependent.
- This platform is designed for an adversarial environment where privacy and operational security must coexist.

## Legal & Jurisdictional Considerations

This project is not intended as a consumer-facing service. Data processing occurs in the context of organizational collaboration within EVE Online.

Where applicable:

- Data handling aligns with general data protection principles (e.g. minimization, purpose limitation).
- Formal data subject rights may be limited by operational requirements.

## Policy Changes

- This policy may be updated as the application evolves.
- Material changes will be documented.
- Continued use of the platform implies acceptance of the current policy.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions or concerns, contact the project maintainers through established internal channels.

## Final Note

This privacy policy reflects a balance between:

- Functional necessity
- Operational security
- Respect for user privacy

The platform intentionally avoids unnecessary data collection and external dependencies while remaining aligned with the realities of the EVE Online ecosystem.
