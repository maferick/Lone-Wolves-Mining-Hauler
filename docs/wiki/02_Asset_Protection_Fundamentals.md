# Asset Protection Fundamentals

## Route planning

- Favor high-sec routes when collateral exceeds 1B ISK.
- Avoid predictable timing on repeat runs.
- Coordinate with Dispatch for route overrides.

## Cargo discipline

- Never split collateralized cargo without approval.
- Use secure containers when instructed.

## Threat indicators

- Multiple neutral scouts shadowing your path.
- Fleet scouts on key choke points.
- Repeated ship bumps at undock.

If you spot any indicator, **pause the run** and contact Dispatch.
